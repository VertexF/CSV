# The Job Seekers Processing Program

This application is using JavaFX based and a work in progress. This is a mock up a program what to process Job Seekers at a job centre.

The idea is that you have a CSV file which is loaded into a table view giving you a look at all your job seekers that day. This will give basic information about the unemployeed person. When clicked on it will load a web file that has all the detailed information about the individual such as commitment contract and proof of job search etc.

The interviewer can then fill out information on the JavaFX program which will write data to that web file on a server allowing the unemployeed person to access it once they have signed in.

Once completed the interviewer can remove that row in the table view and then they will be ready for the next unemployeed person.
